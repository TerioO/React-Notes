# About the app

Create notes with 5 properties:
 - title
 - date
 - time
 - description
 - category

Add/delete categories, sort existing notes by date/title, open notes from select category, edit/delete note, search through notes for keywords.

The app uses only local storage API to store your notes. You can delete your notes whenever you want, export your notes and everything related to the app as JSON object and import it later.

In hindsight, I should've used modals and select components from MUI since I'm already using it, which would've saved me quite some time, but I gave it a try myself.

For testing purposes, use this object:
